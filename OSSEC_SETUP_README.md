## üß† Very Important Tips

- If you plan to integrate OSSEC with the built web frontend, ensure `/var/ossec/bin/ossec-control` and other necessary scripts is accessible via `sudo` without password prompts. To do this, do the following
    1. Run this command
        `sudo visudo`

    2. Paste the following at the bottom of the file and save:
        `<yourusername> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control`
        `<yourusername> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /opt/ossec-dashboard/scripts/sync_ossec_alerts.sh`

    3. Replace <yourusername> with your computer username. THis is to prevent passwordless login for sudo commands used in the app for ossec services

- Keep your SMTP configuration secure ‚Äî avoid hardcoding credentials.
